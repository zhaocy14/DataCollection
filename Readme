Task: write a code to collect data from sensors and the driver:

Sensors:                            Data Flame                               Frequency
Thermal Camera: IRCamera.py         24x32 2D matrix                             4Hz
IMU: IMU.py                         a list of 9 elements                        >30Hz
LiDAR: LiDAR_processor.py           300x300 2D matrix / a list of 4 elements    8Hz
RGB Camera: RGBCamera.py            3-channel numpy array (480, 640, 3)         >30Hz

Driver:
ControlOdometryDriver.py            a list of 9 elements                    >30Hz

Tips:
Among all the sensors, the IRCamera may be the slowest. So, in our previous design, we used thread to read and update other
sensors. And we collectd other sensors data when we update the new thermal image. Therefore, we can avoid the time differences
between different sensors. If you have better idea, you are welcome to design the data collection in your way.

Each data point in the dataset should contain one flame of each sensors data. Among them the camera images(thermal and RGB)
and the LiDAR data will be the input of our network, the IMU and driver, will be used to label the data.

The LiDAR data is the top-view of the operation area. 300x300 means a 300cm x 300cm area. This is very wide. You can make
it smaller by extracting one small part inside it. While the 4 elements is the coordinate of user's legs.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

We use Anydesk to connect our walker. The account is 353989124. The password will be sent to you by Wechat.

BTW, remember to set the record_mode = True when using Driver in the ControlOdometryDriver.py, otherwise you will find
it hard to push the walker.
